        "Bank XYZ has been observing a lot of customers closing their accounts or switching to competitor banks over the past couple of quarters. As such, this has caused a huge dent in the quarterly revenues and might drastically affect annual revenues for the ongoing financial year, causing stocks to plunge and market cap to reduce by X %. A team of business, product, engineering and data science folks have been put together to arrest this slide. \n",

        "__Definition of churn__ : A customer having closed all their active accounts with the bank is said to have churned. Churn can be defined in other ways as well, based on the context of the problem. A customer not transacting for 6 months or 1 year can also be defined as to have churned, based on the business requirements "
