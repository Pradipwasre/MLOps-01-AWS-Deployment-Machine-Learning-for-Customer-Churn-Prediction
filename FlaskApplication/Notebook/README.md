Delivering Business Value: MLOps Project for Customer Churn Prediction with Python on AWS

* In this machine learning churn project, we implement a churn prediction model in Python using ensemble techniques.

Description Of Project:

A prominent bank has observed a significant number of customers closing their accounts or moving to rival banks in recent quarters. This decline has greatly impacted their quarterly revenues and could substantially affect annual revenues for the current fiscal year, leading to a decrease in stocks and market capitalization. The objective is to predict which customers are likely to churn so that the bank can take necessary actions to retain them.

In this machine learning project focused on churn prediction, we are provided with customer data detailing their past transactions with the bank along with some demographic information. We analyze this data to establish relationships between various data features and a customer's likelihood to churn, and then develop a classification model to predict whether a customer will leave the bank or stay. Additionally, we present model predictions through various visualizations, providing insights into which factors contribute to customer churn.

This project guides you through the entire lifecycle of a data science project within the banking industry, starting from defining the problem statement to preparing the model for deployment.
