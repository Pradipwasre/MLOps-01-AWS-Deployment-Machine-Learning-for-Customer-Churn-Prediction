üîß Project Workflow Overview:
Source Control with AWS CodeCommit

Centralized our codebase with AWS CodeCommit, ensuring efficient version control and collaboration.
Continuous Integration with AWS CodeBuild
Set up AWS CodeBuild to automatically build and test our application whenever new code is pushed, ensuring the integrity of our builds.
Continuous Deployment with AWS CodePipeline


Automated the entire CI/CD pipeline with AWS CodePipeline, seamlessly integrating CodeCommit, CodeBuild, and ECS for streamlined deployments.
Container Management with AWS ECR & ECS

Used AWS ECR to store Docker images and AWS ECS for scalable container orchestration with Fargate, eliminating the need to manage servers.
Load Balancing with AWS ELB

Ensured high availability and reliability with AWS Elastic Load Balancing, distributing traffic efficiently across our ECS services.
Monitoring and Logging with AWS CloudWatch

Monitored our application's performance and set up robust logging mechanisms using AWS CloudWatch, keeping a close eye on key metrics.
Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

Automated the provisioning of our AWS infrastructure using Terraform, ensuring consistency and repeatability in our deployments.

üìÇ Terraform Configuration Highlights:
ECR Repository Setup: Managed Docker images efficiently.
CodeBuild Project: Automated the build process for our application.
CodePipeline Configuration: Streamlined CI/CD pipeline.
ECS Cluster and Service: Deployed and managed containers with ease.
Elastic Load Balancer: Ensured seamless traffic distribution.
IAM Roles and Policies: Managed access control and security.
